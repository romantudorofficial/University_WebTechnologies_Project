                    <p>
                        The MaMa - Manners Matter website will interact with two main user groups: customers and administrators. 
                        Customers are people who want to learn more about netiquette, and administrators are responsible for adding 
                        new lessons to the website. Users will be required to create an account and log in to access the website's features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The website's user interface will be designed to follow industry-standard web design principles and best practices. 
                        The layout will be intuitive, with easy-to-use navigation and clear calls-to-action. The site's design will be consistent 
                        across all pages, with a header that includes the site's logo and a sign-out button that returns the user to the login page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The user interface will be web-based, and will be designed to be responsive and accessible across a range of devices and 
                        screen sizes. The site will include standard buttons and functions, such as a help button and navigation buttons, as well 
                        as keyboard shortcuts and other accessibility features as needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The user interface will be designed to meet accessibility standards and ensure that all users can access the site's content 
                        and features, regardless of their abilities. In addition, the website will comply with relevant data privacy regulations to 
                        ensure that user data is protected.

                        browser and an internet connection. The software does not interact with any specific hardware components and is not dependent

                    <p>
                        The MaMa - Manners Matter website will interact with a database where information about the users will be stored, including 
                        their email address, password, name, other specific information about them, and the number of points they have accumulated. 
                        This database will be used for the log in component, for creating the leaderboard, and for keeping track of which lessons a 
                        user has already completed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The website is built using HTML, PHP, and CSS programming languages, and will interact with the database using SQL queries. The 
                        website will not interact with any other specific software components or libraries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To access the database, the website will connect to it using the appropriate credentials and communication protocols. The data 
                        items that will be exchanged between the website and the database include user login information, user profile information, lesson 
                        completion data, and leaderboard data. The purpose of each data item is to facilitate user authentication, personalize the user 
                        experience, and provide feedback on user progress.

                        <li>Web Browser: The website will interact with web browsers to deliver its content to users. The supported web browsers will 
                            be Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. The website will follow web standards such as HTML5 and CSS3 to ensure compatibility 
                            across different web browsers.</li>
                        <li>HTTP: The website will use HTTP protocol for communication between the web server and client web browsers.</li>
                        <li>HTTPS: The website will use HTTPS protocol to encrypt and secure data transmission between the web server and client web browsers.</li>

                                accumulated through completing lessons. It is of medium priority as it is not critical to the core 
                                functionality of the system but provides a gamification aspect to the learning experience.

                    <h3>5.1 Performance Requirements</h3>

                    <p>
                        The project is implemented in PHP which is a superior option 
                        for integrating or customizing any popular CMS for our project. 
                        Even if it is slower than Node.js , PHP comes with more advantages
                        as it has been stated. We will use a database as a storage for many
                        parameters: from user data to questions answers. It is very important
                        for us to have a dynamic web application, that is why, we will use them
                        in order to offer the high wanted performance. For suggestions we will
                        use the property of PHP to send the user directly to the specific content
                        that he would like to have an idea on how to behave in a specific context.

                    <p>
                        The only ways that could be with loss of data might be when deleting a category
                        of lessons or a specific lesson. But everything is handled by the back-end, so 
                        there should not be any issues. In case of something, the other admins could redo
                        everything.
                    </p>

                    <h3>5.3 Security Requirements</h3>

                    <p>
                        First of all, the application will use verification of the roles: if it is an admin
                        or if it has an account. This is for being sure that no person will use it without 
                        having an account, so the other users will be protected.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Secondly, the passwords will be encrypted, this will provide safety for each user that
                        their account will NOT be stolen by another person. It is very important to keep them safe.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Eventually, if the application grows, it will be changed to HTTPS for more security than the
                        current state that we are in.

                    <p>
                        It is able to get new categories of lessons and to add
                        lessons to every existent category. It is also able to
                        delete categories and lessons. This should show that it 
                        is a flexible application down for changes of its content.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But the application, might have additional future features,
                        such as being able to modify the navigation bar. That would 
                        be a nice attribute for implementation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It could be adapted really quickly if we would use a new page
                        for doing all this hard-work automatically.

                    <p>
                        The database would be a relational one. This would help us
                        implement faster joins between tables in order to find the content
                        faster. The application will be divided in more tables depending on
                        types: user, info about questions, lessons, categories. Then we will just
                        create connections between them through ids.

                        The application is already written in English, but over time we could
                        implement a way of displaying the content in different languages through
                        the help of Google. At first, might be used only important langauges [ spoken 
                        by a higher number of people].

                    <p>
                        We will keep hidden the users' data. It is important for us
                        that they will feel safe while using our application. So, the
                        data that we will use, it will NOT be made public, it will be 
                        used only for filtrations, no more. The only Information that 
                        will be made public is the user's score, for our Scoreboard.
                        But this score will be seen only if he is in Top 10. Otherwise,
                        it will be seen only by him.

                        As it has been said before, we woud like to implement those functionalities
                        that have been described in the section 5. They would be a huge advantage for
                        our application. We would also like to implement some further functionalities
                        such as:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>admins being able to move the categories around: changing the order in the navigation bar</li>
                        <li>basic users being able to come up with their ideas and feedbacks in a special page</li>
                        <li>allowing users to have group chats based on their preferences, scores</li>
                        <li>allowing users to come up with additional Information about each lesson, category
                            and being able to send it, afterwards to be checked if it is correct.
                        </li>
                        <li>would also help our users if we would implement a way of allowing video usage and audio as well</li>
                    </ol>
