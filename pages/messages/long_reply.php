        <p>
            An anxiety-inducing but widespread claim online is that the average text response time is 90 seconds‚Äîbut
            there‚Äôs reason to be skeptical. Many places repeating this factoid vaguely cite a wireless industry trade
            association as their source, but when I contacted them to fact check, that organization‚Äôs research team was
            unsure as to the claim‚Äôs basis or origin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Okay, so maybe the average isn‚Äôt 90 seconds. Maybe a non-response officially becomes rude after 20 minutes.
            That‚Äôs what some folks took from a 2018 study by Google, but it‚Äôs not exactly what the researchers wrote.
            Rather, they said the people they studied ‚Äúfelt pressure to respond immediately or within a reasonable
            amount of time, typically between 20 minutes to the end of that day, to avoid breaking etiquette and
            offending the sender.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
            So how quickly should you answer texts? The answer might seem like a maddeningly subjective ‚Äúit depends,‚Äù
            but we have a few texting rules that can help clarify, starting with:
        </p>
        <h2>Text unto others as you would have them text unto you.</h2>
        <p>
            This goes for content as well as timing. If you‚Äôd feel weird getting a dancing hot dog sticker from your
            boss or a John Cena GIF from your mom, don‚Äôt send them one. If you‚Äôre not sure where the boundaries are,
            consider the perspective of the person you‚Äôre texting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider also whomever you‚Äôre texting near:
        </p>
        <h2>Mind your surroundings.</h2>
        <p>
            Wordlessly pulling out your phone to field a text in the middle of a face-to-face conversation tends to read
            as ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care much about this interaction.‚Äù Likewise, texting at the movies is a nonverbal invitation for
            strangers to hiss at you. And the reasons to avoid doing so while driving extend far beyond decorum, but you
            get the idea.
        </p>
        <h2>Slow replies can be rude, but double texting is sometimes worse.</h2>
        <p>
            The asynchronous nature of texting‚Äîthat you don‚Äôt have to drop what you‚Äôre doing and reply this second‚Äîis
            part of its appeal. You‚Äôre texting so as to be unobtrusive, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            Say you text a colleague to ask an after-hours work question. They might love to give you a quick reply, but
            they might also be reading their kid a bedtime story‚Äîin which case texting them again a few minutes later is
            not a kind look. In this example, the breach of etiquette comes not from the lack of immediate response but
            from the seeming demand for one.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exceptions to this rule exist, but many are hectic and raise this question: why not talk on the phone?
        </p>
        <h2>Not everything should be said via text.</h2>
        <p>
            If a dog has done something amusing on the internet, please text me the link. If your car just got
            rear-ended, maybe call me instead. If someone in the family‚Äôs water broke and you‚Äôre headed to the hospital,
            a phone call is warranted, but if you just need a copy of Aunt Kate‚Äôs recipe for lemon bars, texting is
            preferable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, and if you‚Äôre ending a relationship, doing it via text decidedly sends a message, albeit not a
            sympathetic one.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Not every text merits a response immediately. Or maybe ever.
        </h2>
        <p>
            There are three arguments here. First, some messages don‚Äôt necessitate a reply. (‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my way‚Äù and ‚Äúsorry,
            I‚Äôm running a few minutes late‚Äù are fine examples.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Secondly, some replies take time, like when you need to check your calendar, bank account, or horoscope
            before responding to an invitation. That said, to be polite, it might be worthwhile to dash off some quick
            variant of ‚ÄúLet me get back to you‚Äù while you‚Äôre deciding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, expecting instantaneous responses will make you crazy any time one is not forthcoming. Breathe. Your
            phone will most likely buzz again soon enough.
        </p>
