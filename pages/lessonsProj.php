				How to get started

			<p class="sectionBody">
				So you've found yourself in a virtual context and you don't know how to properly behave?
                Perhaps you have to take part in a virtual meeting and you're not quite sure when to 
                open your mic or if you should leave your camera on or off, or you're just texting
                some friends but are unsure when and how to use emojis. Regardless of your specific situation,
                MaMa is here to help! 
                Just select a category you're interested in from the options on top of the page and get 
                started with your learning journey. 
			</p>
            <p class="sectionBody">
                Politeness always pays off - just let MaMa show you how!

				A Short Guide to the Lessons
			</header>
			<p class="sectionBody">
				After you've chosen the category you'd like to learn more about, you'll be able
                to see the available lessons for it. Each of them has a set difficulty, suggested
                by a coloured circle next to their title. A green circle means an easy lesson, an
                orange circle means the lesson will be slightly more difficult, while a red circle 
                means the highest difficulty.
			</p>
            <p class="sectionBody">
                Don't be afraid to approach a tougher lesson, though,
                because the higher the difficulty, the more points you'll get for completing it! 
                And who knows, maybe that'll even earn you a place on MaMa's leaderboard!
