                For an informal setting, you can go for a collared shirt, polo shirt, or a neat t-shirt paired with 
                chinos, khakis, or dark-colored jeans. You can also consider wearing a casual blazer or cardigan to 
                add a touch of sophistication. Opt for clean and well-maintained footwear that complements your outfit.

                Choose a tailored blouse, button-down shirt, or a professional dress with a modest neckline and length. 
                Pair it with dress pants, a skirt, or a formal dress that exudes professionalism. Stick to neutral colors 
                or classic patterns, and avoid loud or flashy prints. Accessorize with simple and elegant jewelry, and ensure

                minimal accessories.

                In a formal setting, it is advisable to use emojis sparingly. You can consider using a smiling face üôÇ at the end of 
                a message to add a touch of warmth or friendliness. An occasional thumbs-up üëç can be used to acknowledge agreement 
                or approval. However, it's crucial to gauge the formality of the conversation and the expectations of the participants 
                to ensure that emojis are appropriate.
