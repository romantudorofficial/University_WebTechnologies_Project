# University - Web Technologies - Project

This is the workspace for the Web Technologies project from university (year 2, semester 2): Manners Matter!

# This will be the place where the tasks will be written in subsections

## 21.05.2023

### Problem 
We have to synchronize our databases -> we should have the same users, and items in them for better debugging (in case of finding issues)
Moreover, we have to create some admins: us (because we created the app) 
After a while, we will decide what users we will add as well

### Tasks
1. Create the database called `project`
2. Create the tables like in : https://docs.google.com/document/d/15mzF2AO19qKVUY87MHRoZNO1PCOv84kD5HTkh1ukZfA/edit?usp=sharing  (copy-paste)
3. For creating the admins: we will just create an account using our names and a password , for not forgetting about it, complete below (should be a proper email that contains `@gmail.com` or `@smth.com`)

*Maria* <br />
first name: Maria<br />
last name: Gheorghiu<br />
email: mariagheorghiu27@ymail.com<br />
password: admin123<br />

*Tudor* <br />
first name: Tudor<br />
last name: Gălățan<br />
email: tudorgalatan@gmail.com<br />
password: admin321<br />

*Catalina* <br />
first name: Catalina-Cristina<br />
last name:Vornicu<br />
email:catalina.tiger25@gmail.com<br />
password:admin123<br />

4. For checking the correctness of the email or making them as checked, we must remember that we will use Ajax and it will be learned at this lab12, so we will do this after 
5. Write `done` next to your name when you finished this first task

`Maria` : done<br />
`Tudor` : done<br />
`Catalina` : done<br />
